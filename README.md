# Endless Fight
A 3D endless runner shooter game in unusual form. (PROTOTYPE) 

The game is an endless runner shooter that I have seen in Youtube "I Paid Game Developers on Fiverr to Make the Same Game" video(third game) by BadGameDev.
When I saw the game, I wanted to make it myself. I made more or less same.

Left Ctrl & Mouse left click(0) -> Fire 
WASD -> Movement
